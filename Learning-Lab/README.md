# Learning Lab: Data Processing Fundamentals

## Overview
This hands-on learning lab teaches the fundamentals of data loading and processing using real-world datasets. Students will learn essential pandas operations, data exploration techniques, and practical data analysis skills through step-by-step tutorials.

## Learning Objectives
- Master basic data loading from CSV, Excel, and JSON files
- Understand data exploration and analysis techniques
- Learn to identify and handle missing values
- Distinguish between categorical and numerical data
- Apply data quality assessment methods
- Practice with real-world datasets

## Lab Structure

### 1. Simple Data Loading (`01_Simple_Data_Loading.ipynb`)
- Import essential libraries (pandas, numpy)
- Create and save sample data in multiple formats
- Read CSV, Excel, and JSON files
- Compare file formats and sizes
- Basic data exploration commands
- Hands-on practice exercises

### 2. Titanic Data Processing (`02_Simple_Titanic_Data_Processing.ipynb`)
- Load and explore the famous Titanic dataset
- Step-by-step data analysis approach
- Missing value detection and analysis
- Categorical vs numerical column identification
- Data type checking and validation
- Statistical analysis of passenger data
- Age group analysis and demographics
- Data quality assessment
- Practice exercises with real data

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with Jupyter Notebook environment
- Understanding of basic data concepts

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Required Packages**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy openpyxl
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Start with the Notebooks**
   - Begin with `01_Simple_Data_Loading.ipynb` for basics
   - Progress to `02_Simple_Titanic_Data_Processing.ipynb` for real-world practice

## Included Datasets

### Titanic Dataset (`titanic.csv`)
- Real historical data from the RMS Titanic
- Contains passenger information including age, gender, class, survival status
- Perfect for learning data exploration and analysis techniques
- 891 passengers with 12 features each

## Key Learning Topics

### Data Loading Fundamentals
- Reading different file formats (CSV, Excel, JSON)
